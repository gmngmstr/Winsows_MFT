# MFTW
## Multi-Function Timer: Windows

MFTW is a timer made to cycle through multiple timers with varying times and play an mp3 file of your choice on your computer. The timer can also loop through all of the timers indefinitely until manually stopped. This program has been tested on windows 7 and 10 and should work on windows 8.1 as well.


## Features
MFTW can do the following:
- Add presumably unlimited timers (Though performance will vary)
- Uses of mp3 files for sound at the end of the timers
- Can use a different sound for each timer
- Can stop the timer at any point


## How to install
1. Download `Windows_MFT_Setup.exe`
2. Run `Windows_MFT_Setup.exe`


Notes:
`Windows_MFT.py` is not needed to run the program. It is there to view the code and modify if needed.
If you post a modified version of the program please refrence this repo as the original. Thanks
